# Speed-measuring-device-using-arduino
This device is made using arduino uno or arduino mini as microcontroller.
IR sensors with analog value to measure a speed of an object moving inside the fluid.
LCD Display to show speed. You can also use serial monitor instead.
Before uploading the final code fisrt you will have to do the configuration of the IR Sensors.
The value of the sensor varies at different places and at different conditions due to the availability of the infrared radiations presnts in the environment.


Precaution:

Don't perform this experiment in sunlight or in open area in day light because the sensor will detect the infrared present in the sunlight.
